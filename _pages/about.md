I am a graduate student working with [Prof. Jia-Bin Huang](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~jbhuang/) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Virginia Tech. My research topics include **Machine Perception, Visual Representation Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Embodied Vision Learning**. During my internship at [Borealis.ai](https://www.borealisai.com), I work with [Hossein Hajimirsadeghi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hNNBdHcAAAAJ&hl=en) and
[Greg Mori](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/) on Graph Generation problem.

Proir to that, I worked with [Prof. Chun-Yi Lee](http://cymaxwelllee.wixsite.com/elsa) and [Prof. Shang-Hong Lai](http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~lai/) at National Tsing Hua University, [Dr. Yi-Hsuang Yang](http://mac.citi.sinica.edu.tw/~yang/) and [Dr. Li Su](https://sites.google.com/site/lisupage/) at Academia Sinica.
